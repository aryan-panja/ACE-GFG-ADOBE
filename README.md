# ACE-GFG-ADOBE

## Our project is entirely made in Google Collab so that anyone can run our projects easily. Every dependencies, libraries will be installed.

### About this project, File Systems, Inputs and Outputs

We have 4 different files include:-
1. Regularizing Curves
2. Detecting polygons
3. Symmetries in the curves and
4. Complementing the curves.

## Steps to use this Code.

`INPUT`
For the input we have the option to take ong files as well as csv files.
After uploading the png files or the csv files, if csv then it reads the file and get the curves.
After that it runs various functions according to the cases.

`OUTPUT`
The given output will be displayed in the given file itself as well as it will be saved too.
You will se the plot of the ouput in your collab or jupyter notebook.

## Regularizing The Curves

In this module the given input shapes get regularized.

Using numpy we get the shapes and try to convert the shapes in proper lines like, lines, cirlces, ellipses.

## Detecting The Polygons

For this we are using OpenCV to get the shapes. And after that we are finding out the contours.
After finding the contours we are marking the polygons with their names on the output for the user.

## Symmetry

Again for the symmetry we are using the OpenCV.
We are trying to find out the contours and with those contours we are trying to implement the symmetrical lines on the input shapes.

## Completion Of The Curves

For this just input the png or csv and output will be shown.
